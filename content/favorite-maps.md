# I'm Santa Claus!

And I'm his friend Jesus. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. I can explain. It's very valuable. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!

That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Is that a cooking show? You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Shut up and take my money! __No!__ *Don't jump!* For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!

## And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

Bender, this is Fry's decisionâ€¦ and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

1. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.
2. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!
3. With gusto.
